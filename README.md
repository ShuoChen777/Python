# Python

This is a project that was made for the IB CS HL Internal Assessment.
I learned a lot from this, so I'm pasting the code here, even though I'm sure that a lot of it exists on this site already.
It doesn't matter to me. I want to improve on my thinking skills with programming.
This took me way longer than I thought it would.
